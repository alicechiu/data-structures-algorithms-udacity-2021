# **Data Structures & Algorithms**

## **Overview**

In this course you will learn data structures and algorithms by solving 80+ practice problems. You will begin
each course by learning to solve defined problems related to a particular data structure and algorithm. By
the end of each course, you would be able to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms for
any open-ended problem and implement a solution based on your design choices.

## **Introduction**
* Intro
* Python Refresher
* How to Solve Problems
* Big O Notation
* Course Project: Unscramble Computer Science Problems
    * Deconstruct a series of open-ended problems into smaller
components (e.g, inputs, outputs, series of functions).

## **Data Structures**
* Collection data structures
* Recursion
* Trees
* Maps and Hashing
* Course Project: Show Me the Data Structures
    * Solve a series of open-ended practice problems such as LRU Cache,
Private Blockchain, File Recursion and many more. Hone your
skills to identify and implement appropriate data structures and
corresponding methods which meet given constraints.

## **Basic Algorithms**
* Binary Search
* Sorting Algorithms
* Divide & Conquer Algorithms
* Course Project: Problems vs Algorithms
    * A series of real-world open ended problems such as request routing
for web server, search-term auto-completion
and Fibonacci heap which train you to apply suitable data structures
and algorithms under different context.

## **Advanced Algorithms**
* Greedy Algorithms 
* Graph Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming
* Linear Programming
* Course Project: Route Planner
    * In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one
used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two
points on a map. You will first select and implement appropriate
data-structure to represent points on a map and then implement the
A* algorithm to find shortest path.
