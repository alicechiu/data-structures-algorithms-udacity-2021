#Step 3 - Calculate Big O
Once you have completed your solution for each problem,
perform a run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of your solution.
Document this for each problem and include this in your submission

##Task0
The time complexity for accessing the first and last elements is best represented by O(1). The reason is because we are
accessing the first and last records of the list. Regardless of the list size, we can instantly
retrieve the first and last records.

##Task1
The code is using O(n^2) since there are nested loops.

##Task2
The for loop and if-not-in statements has O(n) time complexity since we are iterating
through the dictionary to see if the values are in the list or not. The time it takes to iterate
is relative to the size of calls list.

##Task3
The for loop has O(1) time complexity due to getting the length of the calls list. Then, in the sort
function, it has O(n logn) time complexity due to the fact that we are dividing the new list
and rearranging it in ascending order.

##Task4
The worst case time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loop to find if a particular
element exists in the list or not.
